# Mythical Creature Family Tree

Create a program that simulates a simple family tree of mythical creatures, where the progenitor of the family tree is at the root, and their descendants are represented as nodes in a binary tree.

Each mythical creature can have up to two direct descendants. The program allows users to:

- Add creatures to the tree  
- Search for a specific creature  
- Find and display that creature’s ancestors  
- Print the full tree structure

## Program Requirements

Your menu should allow the user to:

- **Add a child or root**
- **Print the entire tree**
- **Search the tree for a specific creature**
  - If found, print all of its ancestors
