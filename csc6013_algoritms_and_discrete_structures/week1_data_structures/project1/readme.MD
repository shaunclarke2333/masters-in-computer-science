Goal:
Create a program that reads a list of Integer numbers from a file named "data.txt" (use your own file with about 10 numbers - no repetitions and one number per line);
Store those numbers into an array a and sort it - a.sort();
Use the linked list and node classes seen in class to store the ordered elements of a into a LinkedList structure L;
Ask the user a Integer value x;
    Look for the position to insert x in L:
    If the value x is already in L, remove it;
If it is not, insert x in the appropriated position so L remains sorted;
Go to your IDE and try to program it (your code must run correctly on IDLE);
Save your program in a .py file and submit it.
