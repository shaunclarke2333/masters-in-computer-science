Project Assignment:
    Instructions
    Create a program that implements a sort algorithm of your choice and applies it to a random vector of 1,000 elements
    Repeat the process applying it to random vectors of 2,000, 3,000, ... up to 10,000 elements
    Compute the time complexity of your algorithm and verify if the time it takes to your 1,000 to 10,000 corresponds to the time complexity prediction. You should use CProfile to record how long the sorting takes for each array. 
    Besides the implementation of your program, write a short report describing your experiences and conclusion. Your report must include the following points:

    big oh class of the sorting algorithm in question, with an explanation
    screenshots of the C Profiler
    graph plotting the size of the random arrays (x axis) and the time taken to sort (y axis)
    your reflections on how the C Profile data relates to what you have learned about algorithmic analysis and in particular to the big oh class of your algorithm.
